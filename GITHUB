		0.  I know this file is a bit inconsistent right now, but can you please use 
		    “English” style spacing with parentheses consistently in new code here? Format 
		    it like:
		ea3aaf17947d4f3048579d5979b99fda5cba8899
	    
		1.  Please keep the data members and member functions grouped in each section – 
		    you’ve got data members above and below the member functions here.
		2a00af5423f04fd67b94435d4c9aa277cb2cef3a
	    
		2.  You should use required_address_space in place of m_bus and m_bus_mem. It lets 
		    the user configure the address space number and takes care of validating that 
		    the address space exists.

		3.  Please use the logmacro.h utilities for compile-time configurable logging.

		4.  Should this be checked when mounting a disk image rather than on every sector 
		    access?
		12b2318a7fa75326cdd117ccaf24ef598b53972d
	    
		5.  Should this be const-qualified?
		ab4023f8002
	    
		6.  If you use required_device_array for the disks, you can just index it rather 
		    than using conditional operators.
		872a420ed9bd3b4c25c4d5d660e5b9f6a8ab8161
	    
		7.  Why are you using the unaligned read/write functions here? The offset is 
		    shifted to the left by 1, so an unaligned access is impossible.
		1e1b9496ae1bda861fe40f50c697c8d2d57d83c6
	    
		8.  You need to check machine().side_effects_disabled() before applying read side 
		    effects, or chaos ensues when debugger memory windows are open. Also, it’s 
		    safer to use std::size rather than sizeof if you want the number of elements in 
		    an array (it will give a compile error if you inadvertently cause the array to 
		    decay to a pointer, etc.).
		6a7225bf602
	    
		9.  You need to hook the load and unload events on the hard disks to do this, as 
		    MAME won’t prevent the user from unmounting a hard disk on-the-fly.

	10. Have the owner install the device in its address space. This is a very fragile 
	    way of doing things.

		11. Please sort these. It makes it easier to keep track of things.

		12. Please #include local project headers before library headers.

		13. Don’t use ram_device unnecessarily. It has numerous issues.
		4d4065af9d6
	    
		14. Can you get rid of the extra space on the function calls check_mem_violation 
		    (...)? The rest of the code has no space between function name and opening 
		    parenthesis of arguments.
		ff44b90522c
	    
		15. You need to check machine().side_effects_disabled() before read side effects.
	    
		16. Since you know what these address spaces will be, you should use 
		    memory_access::specific<...> to improve performance.
		41f695f4b55343e50c827d490f3c6ffc70536607
	    
		17. As you’re calling this from read handlers and it has side effects, you need to 
		    check machine().side_effects_disabled() before causing side effects.
		    Also, another stray space in signal_violation (violation_bits);.
	    
		18. You can put device classes in anonymous namespaces, but the device type 
		    definition needs to be in the global namespace right now.
		57e2756f852
	    
		19. RAM size configuration won’t work if you do this – you need to check the size 
		    of the RAM on start and install it with correct mirroring.
		b10a3e51ebe618726978c2ed8f62c849c0d0ee4c
	    
		20. You should really use a memory_access::specific<...> for these.
	    
		21. It’s fine to do it here. Alternatively, you can use a driver init callback to 
		    do it if different systems have different address line mappings.
		860e4511244
	    
		22. You don’t need the ROM_SYSTEM_BIOS and ROM_BIOS stuff if there’s only one BIOS 
		    version. If there are multiple versions, you should use a mnemonic tag and 
		    description in the ROM_SYSTEM_BIOS macro.
